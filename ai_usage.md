# AI Use Statement

- AI tools (specifically the built-in Gemini assistant in the Colab environment and occasionally external LLMs like ChatGPT) were utilized in this project for the following purposes:

- Refining Writing and Clarity: To polish and improve the readability of Markdown sections, comments, and documentation (e.g., the README.md and project report outlines).

- Debugging Assistance: For minor debugging tasks, particularly related to sklearn model implementation, plotting libraries, and ensuring the correct application of data scaling.

All core coding, statistical analysis, model training, feature extraction (AAC), and result verification were completed manually. Every generated output was thoroughly reviewed and verified for scientific and technical accuracy.
